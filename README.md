## The Chrome/Edge extension (Character counter for a LinkedIn post) 

LinkedIn post has a limit of 3,000 characters. Unfortunately, the post form doesn't display in real time how many characters the user adds and how many characters the user has beforethe limit. The LinkedIn Character Counter extension solves this problem.


### How it works.
- This extension helps users to understand how many characters are still available up to the limit at the time of creating a LinkedIn post.
- The user can move the information pop-up to any place on the page.
- The pop-up display in real-time mode shows how many characters the user added to the post and how many characters the user has before the limit ends.
- The pop-up will change the color from blue to red when there are 100 characters before the limit.
